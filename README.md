# Hi, my name is Alexandr!

I have been passionately developing in Python for over two years now, combining it with my job. Developed several projects from scratch to placement on the Internet. Now we are planning to write a telegram bot, a project on FastAPI, participate in open source and test tasks.

I completed my profession as a Python developer from hexlet. Previously, I studied python in the courses of [Sergei Balakirev](https://stepik.org/users/345061624/profile) using a stepik. I graduated from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University with a degree in design engineer.

In my work, I often decomposed tasks. I love solving logic problems. Now I continue to master the heights of Python, flask, HTTP, Django. I'm working on new projects using these technologies.
